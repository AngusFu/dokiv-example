# Introduction to md2vue

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. —— [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

## Inspiration

Inspired by <a href="https://nuxtjs.org">nuxt</a>, [md2vue](https://github.com/AngusFu/md2vue) was initially aimed at transforming markdown texts in our Vue project, which were used both for documentation and demostration.

## Typography & UI
